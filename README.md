MFM-h V3.0 Sketch Lora V1.0.0
---
This is the productional sketch for the third version of the [Multiflexmeter](https://multiflexmeter.nl/) designed for the LoRa module.

The library providing LoRa communication uses an OS-timing system which presents a few constraints in the code. Therefore this sketch is specific for the LoRa version.
